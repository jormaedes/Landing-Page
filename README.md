# RankUp Code: Competitive Programming Landing Page

## 🚀 About The Project

This is a front-end design project completed as part of **The Odin Project (TOP)** curriculum. The main goal was to recreate a static layout from an image model, focusing on structural fidelity and the application of core HTML and CSS concepts.

While the structure is inspired by the TOP assignment, the theme and content were personally chosen and created. The landing page is for a fictional **Competitive Programming** service named "RankUp Code," aiming to motivate and guide developers in contests like Codeforces, LeetCode, and AtCoder.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was built exclusively using the following front-end technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (including Flexbox), and to implement the chosen High-Tech color palette (Electric Blue and Dark Gray).

## ✨ Features and Structure

The landing page includes the following sections, strictly following the original design structure:

1.  **Header:** Contains the logo (`RankUp Code`) and basic navigation links.
2.  **Hero Section:** A prominent area with a strong title and a primary Call to Action (CTA).
3.  **Key Information:** Four informative boxes highlighting the pillars of competitive programming, specifically:
    * Codeforces
    * AtCoder
    * LeetCode
    * HackerRank
4.  **Quote/Testimonial:** A stylized content area for a testimonial from a successful user.
5.  **Final Call to Action (CTA):** An appealing secondary CTA, inviting the user to sign up.
6.  **Footer:** Copyright information.
